# Phased-Array-Pulse-Doppler-Radar-Tutorial
this repo is for simulating the basic phased array PD radar: its rx signal model and basic signal processing to extract range, velocity, and angle(elevation, azimuth). The corresponding algorithms are matched filtering, Doppler Processing, and 2D DBF. In essense, they are all template matching algorithms.
